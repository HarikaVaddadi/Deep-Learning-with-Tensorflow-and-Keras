# CIFAR10 Using TensorFlow and keras Sequential API in Python

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of images which is widely used to train computer vision algorithms in the field of machine learning. 

The CIFAR10 dataset contains 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images in each class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. 

This repo demonstrates training a simple Convolutional Neural Network to classify CIFAR images. Creating and training our model can be done with a few lines of code as we are using the Keras Sequential API.
